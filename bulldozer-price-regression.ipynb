    "# Predicting Bulldozer Sales Price\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore a dataset and build machine learning models to predict the auction sale price of bulldozers ðŸšœ. This idea and the necessary data were taken from this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The company Fast Iron is creating a \"blue book for bulldozer\", which aims to inform their customers about what the company's heavy equipment is worth at auction. They need a model to predict this price, based on usage, equipment type and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the data was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train.csv:** Training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "- **Valid.csv:** Validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012.\n",
    "- **Test.csv:** Test set, which contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SalesID: Unique identifier of the sale.\n",
    "- MachineID: Unique identifier of a machine. One machine can be sold multiple times.\n",
    "- saleprice: What the machine sold for at auction.\n",
    "- saledate: Date of the sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The key evaluation metric will be the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), between the actual and predicted auction prices. As for most regression models, the goal is to minimize the error of the prediction, when compared to the actual value. \n",
